    <p><h1>Which of your favorite tweeters look great together?</h1></p>
    <p>Twitter lets you group your favorite tweeters together in lists, but lists are a pain to put together. Twitter lists should organize themselves for you, which is what twitlist is here to do. Let twitlist decide which tweeters have the most in common and set up lists for you so you don't have to.</p>
